# faceSelectiveNeuronExperiment

This notebook, faceSelectiveNeuronsExperiment.ipynb, runs experiments to find and study face-selective neurons inside a deep neural network that mimics how the human brain processes visual information. The main goal is to figure out which neurons respond most strongly to face images and measure how selective they are compared to other image categories. The script uses pre-trained models and a brain-inspired framework (TopoNets) to simulate how neural layers react to images. It calculates neuron activations across image datasets, measures how focused each neuron is on faces, and visualizes which images trigger the strongest responses. By identifying and analyzing these face-selective neurons, the experiment helps us better understand how both artificial networks and biological brains represent important visual categories like faces.
